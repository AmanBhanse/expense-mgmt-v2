## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the app, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** or **yarn** (comes with Node.js).

### Run App

- Clone the repo
- Open the repo in the CMD/Terminal of your local machine
- Execute below lines to run the app
  - `npm i`
  - `npm start run`

### The decisions leading to the features and the architecture of the solution.

- Since the overall requirements are simple, having the normal implementation using ReactJs was enough. No need use Redux for state management or complex architecture.

### Any challenges faced during implementation.

- 6 hrs was not enough time to properly fullfill the given requirements. It cost code quality issue.

### What do you think are the most important aspects when developing such an application for a customer (e.g. UX, Performance, ...)? Describe the (to you) two most important aspects in about 100 words each.

- User Experience (UX): A great UX is paramount. It should be intuitive, visually appealing, and easy to navigate. A well-designed interface can significantly improve user satisfaction and engagement.
- Security: Protecting user data is crucial. Robust security measures, such as strong authentication, encryption, and regular security audits, are essential to safeguard sensitive financial information.

### If you had to choose an alternative technology stack for this project, what would it be and why?

A potential alternative stack could be Vue.js for the frontend and Node.js . Vue.js is known for its simplicity and efficient component-based architecture, making it a great choice for rapid development. Node.js

### If given more time or resources, what innovative features or improvements would you add to enhance the application further?

- Better Architecture for Solution
- AI-Powered Insights: Utilize machine learning to analyze spending patterns and provide personalized financial advice.
